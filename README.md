# PRO-C145-BASIC-3D-SHAPES

Goal of the Project:

In Class 145, we learned how to create basic 3D shapes on the web using AFrame framework.
In this project you will practice more on creating shapes in AFrame.

Story:

Shreyas has been learning about three dimensional shapes in his school but it is very difficult for him to visualize the 3D shapes on paper or textbook. Help him to design 3D shapes on the web so that he sees them in 3 dimensions i.e., on x , y and z-axis.

*This is just for your reference. We expect you to apply your own creativity in the project.

Getting Started:

Open VS Code Editor.
Include:
< script src="https://aframe.io/releases/0.6.0/aframe.min.js"> < /script> inside < head>

Try to find different primitive on link: https://aframe.io/docs/1.0.0/introduction/
Specific Tasks to complete the Project:
Choose your own shapes.
Add < a-scene>.
Try to set different attributes like position, rotation, color and scale.
Save the code.
Submitting the Project:
Upload your completed project to your own github account.
Create a new repository named Project 145.
Upload working code to this github repository.
Submit the published link of the project in the Student Dashboard.

Hints:
Few Shapes that can be used.
